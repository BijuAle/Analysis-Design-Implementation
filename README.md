# Analysis-Design-Implementation

Abstract
This report presents the analysis, design and implementation for – “Social Time”, an event planner system developed in object-oriented paradigm. The report is divided into 5 sections, which collectively documents
the analysis, design, and implementation of the system. Each section is accompanied by code snippets.

Introduction

“Social Time’ sets itself apart from the general event planner tools in that it is attendee oriented. The primary reason is that the event date is algorithmically set to the best of feasible timeslots in the attendee.
This report was written as part of the assignment (June 2017) of L5DC’s module – ‘ADI (Analysis, Design, & Implementation)’. The report documents each of the system development stages namely – analysis,
design, and, implementation.

Firstly, use cases for the system were identified which is part of Task 3 (Use Case Diagram). Then, as part of the requirement analysis, Natural Language Analysis (NLA), was conducted to represent domain
level class diagram for the system. This is shown in Task 1 (List of Potential Class & Diagram). Then, dynamic model of the system was designed in Task 2 (Activity Diagram), where the core logic of feasible
timeslot calculation is presented. The final static architecture is presented in Task 4. This contains the class diagram of the final system that includes persistence layer, core business, and presentation layer
with design patterns applied. Lastly, the implementation was done in Java 8 using Netbeans 8.1 with JDK version 1.8.0_121.
